The Interdisciplinary Publishing Lab is a space for students across the Schools of Art & Design and Creative & Cultural Industries to make free use of, to explore all kinds of publishing from printed books and pamphlets to digital technologies. We provide...

- Space to explore and make
- Materials and resources
- Technical advice and instruction
- Events with artists, industry experts and other professionals
- Informal advice on your ideas and projects

The Lab has been running since October, and in that time we’ve hosted workshops, exhibitions and artists, and provided a home for students interested in the book and what it might do for their practice. We’ve got exciting plans for the year ahead, and on 11th March at 12.00pm, we’re throwing the doors open. 

<a href="https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/TomAbba">Tom Abba</a> and <a href="https://www.georgewalkley.com">George Walkley</a> (a publisher and supporter of the Lab) would like to share the roadmap for the Lab, get your feedback on what would be most useful to you, and explore ways you could get involved as we create a community of makers and thinkers across the University and its networks. 

Coffee and tea will be provided&#8212;bring your own lunch!

The session will be followed by a lunchtime talk from <a href="https://www.watershed.co.uk/studio/">the Pervasive Media Studio at Watershed</a> which will be livestreamed in the Lab.
