UWE’s Publishing Lab is an interdisciplinary laboratory space, provided for all our Undergraduate and Postgraduate students to make use of. The Lab is geared toward publishing content from traditional media&#8212;the book; pamphlets; printed forms with which we are familiar&#8212;through to exploration as to how digital technologies impact the processes and creative practices we represent as a community of makers and thinkers across our Schools of Art & Design and Creative & Cultural Industries. Over 2000 students have access to the Lab’s facilities, which are provided on a no-cost, no-barrier-to-entry basis. Layout and production materials are provided, alongside technical advice and instruction where necessary. 

The Lab has close links to publishing and the wider creative industries through live and online events, professional practice opportunities and an entrepreneur-in-residence programme which brings professional publishing experience into the Lab and offers students advice and support on careers, employability and creative startups. 

Our Manifesto:
1. No barriers to entry 
2. Build in public 
3. Leave something behind
4. Make the industry a better place
5. Build and nurture an alumni network
